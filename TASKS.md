## Phase 1: Core Integration (Critical Path)

### 1.1 Connect Web Server to Game Orchestrator üî¥
**Status**: üü¶ In progress  
**Description**: Create the integration layer between the web server and game orchestrator to enable LLM games via the web interface.

**Subtasks**:
- [x] Create `AsyncGameOrchestrator` class that works with FastAPI
- [x] Add game session management to track active games
- [x] Implement background task system for running games
- [x] Create game state synchronization between orchestrator and web server

**Testing**: Verify that clicking "Start LLM Game" creates a game instance

**Notes**: 
- Created async_orchestrator.py with full async/await support
- Integrated with FastAPI using background tasks
- Properly synced game state between orchestrator and server
- Tested and confirmed working (fails on API keys as expected)

---

### 1.2 Implement Start LLM Game Endpoint üî¥
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Description**: Create API endpoint and WebSocket integration for starting LLM games.

**Subtasks**:
- [x] Add POST endpoint `/api/game/start` with LLM configuration
- [x] Create async task to run game loop
- [x] Initialize LLM agents based on configuration
- [x] Send game started notification via WebSocket

**Testing**: Click "Start LLM Game" and verify game initialization in logs

**Notes**:
- Implemented `/api/game/start` endpoint with optional LLM selection
- Added random LLM selection when not specified
- WebSocket notifications working properly
- Frontend button now triggers actual game start

---

### 1.3 Stream LLM Moves via WebSocket üî¥
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Description**: Implement real-time move streaming from LLM agents to frontend.

**Subtasks**:
- [x] Modify orchestrator to emit move events
- [x] Create WebSocket message protocol for moves
- [x] Send move updates with player info and timing
- [x] Update frontend to handle move messages

**Testing**: Start a game and see moves appear on the board in real-time

**Notes**:
- Implemented callbacks in AsyncGameOrchestrator for move, log, and state updates
- WebSocket protocol handles game_state and log message types
- Frontend already set up to receive and display updates
- Move streaming will work once API keys are configured

---

## Phase 2: Error Handling & Reliability

### 2.1 LLM Call Error Handling üî¥
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Add retry logic and timeout handling for LLM API calls.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff retry logic
- [ ] Add configurable timeout per LLM call
- [ ] Create fallback move selection for repeated failures
- [ ] Log and report errors via WebSocket

**Testing**: Simulate API failures and verify graceful handling

---

### 2.2 Move Validation & Recovery üü°
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Handle invalid moves and game state recovery.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Add retry limit for invalid moves
- [ ] Implement move suggestion system for struggling LLMs
- [ ] Create game state recovery mechanism
- [ ] Add move validation statistics

**Testing**: Force invalid moves and verify recovery behavior

---

## Phase 3: Game Controls

### 3.1 Implement Pause/Resume üü°
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Add ability to pause and resume LLM games.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Add game state: playing, paused, stopped
- [ ] Implement pause mechanism in game loop
- [ ] Create resume functionality
- [ ] Update UI button states

**Testing**: Pause during game, wait, then resume

---

### 3.2 Reset Game Functionality üü°
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Ensure reset properly cleans up running games.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Cancel running game tasks on reset
- [ ] Clean up LLM agent instances
- [ ] Reset WebSocket state
- [ ] Clear game history

**Testing**: Reset during active game and start new one

---

### 3.3 LLM Selection UI üü¢
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Allow users to select LLM providers and models from the UI.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Add dropdown menus for white/black players
- [ ] Load available models from configuration
- [ ] Pass selected models to game start endpoint
- [ ] Show selected models in game info

**Testing**: Select different LLMs and verify they're used

---

## Phase 4: Timing & Scoring

### 4.1 Move Time Limits üü°
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Implement time limits per move with automatic forfeit.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Add configurable time limit per move
- [ ] Implement move timer with cancellation
- [ ] Auto-forfeit on timeout
- [ ] Display time remaining in UI

**Testing**: Set short time limit and verify timeout behavior

---

### 4.2 Game Statistics üü¢
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Track and display comprehensive game statistics.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Calculate average move time per player
- [ ] Track thinking time vs API latency
- [ ] Count invalid move attempts
- [ ] Display statistics in UI panel

**Testing**: Complete a game and verify statistics accuracy

---

## Phase 5: Additional Features

### 5.1 Game History & Replay üü¢

**Description**: Save games and allow replay functionality.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Save completed games to JSON format
- [ ] Create game list endpoint
- [ ] Implement replay mode
- [ ] Add PGN export option

**Description**: Implement the configured but missing OpenRouter provider.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Create OpenRouterAgent class
- [ ] Implement API integration
- [ ] Add to agent factory
- [ ] Test with available models

---

### 5.3 Tournament Mode üü¢
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Run multiple games between different LLM combinations.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Create tournament configuration
- [ ] Implement round-robin scheduler
- [ ] Track tournament statistics
- [ ] Generate tournament report

---

## Testing Checklist

After each phase, verify:
