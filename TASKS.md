## Phase 1: Core Integration (Critical Path)

### 1.1 Connect Web Server to Game Orchestrator üî¥
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Create the integration layer between the web server and game orchestrator to enable LLM games via the web interface.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Create `AsyncGameOrchestrator` class that works with FastAPI
- [ ] Add game session management to track active games
- [ ] Implement background task system for running games
- [ ] Create game state synchronization between orchestrator and web server

**Testing**: Verify that clicking "Start LLM Game" creates a game instance

---

### 1.2 Implement Start LLM Game Endpoint üî¥
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Create API endpoint and WebSocket integration for starting LLM games.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Add POST endpoint `/api/game/start` with LLM configuration
- [ ] Create async task to run game loop
- [ ] Initialize LLM agents based on configuration
- [ ] Send game started notification via WebSocket

**Testing**: Click "Start LLM Game" and verify game initialization in logs

---

### 1.3 Stream LLM Moves via WebSocket üî¥
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Implement real-time move streaming from LLM agents to frontend.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Modify orchestrator to emit move events
- [ ] Create WebSocket message protocol for moves
- [ ] Send move updates with player info and timing
- [ ] Update frontend to handle move messages

**Testing**: Start a game and see moves appear on the board in real-time

---

## Phase 2: Error Handling & Reliability

### 2.1 LLM Call Error Handling üî¥
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Add retry logic and timeout handling for LLM API calls.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff retry logic
- [ ] Add configurable timeout per LLM call
- [ ] Create fallback move selection for repeated failures
- [ ] Log and report errors via WebSocket

**Testing**: Simulate API failures and verify graceful handling

---

### 2.2 Move Validation & Recovery üü°
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Handle invalid moves and game state recovery.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Add retry limit for invalid moves
- [ ] Implement move suggestion system for struggling LLMs
- [ ] Create game state recovery mechanism
- [ ] Add move validation statistics

**Testing**: Force invalid moves and verify recovery behavior

---

## Phase 3: Game Controls

### 3.1 Implement Pause/Resume üü°
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Add ability to pause and resume LLM games.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Add game state: playing, paused, stopped
- [ ] Implement pause mechanism in game loop
- [ ] Create resume functionality
- [ ] Update UI button states

**Testing**: Pause during game, wait, then resume

---

### 3.2 Reset Game Functionality üü°
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Ensure reset properly cleans up running games.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Cancel running game tasks on reset
- [ ] Clean up LLM agent instances
- [ ] Reset WebSocket state
- [ ] Clear game history

**Testing**: Reset during active game and start new one

---

### 3.3 LLM Selection UI üü¢
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Allow users to select LLM providers and models from the UI.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Add dropdown menus for white/black players
- [ ] Load available models from configuration
- [ ] Pass selected models to game start endpoint
- [ ] Show selected models in game info

**Testing**: Select different LLMs and verify they're used

---

## Phase 4: Timing & Scoring

### 4.1 Move Time Limits üü°
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Implement time limits per move with automatic forfeit.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Add configurable time limit per move
- [ ] Implement move timer with cancellation
- [ ] Auto-forfeit on timeout
- [ ] Display time remaining in UI

**Testing**: Set short time limit and verify timeout behavior

---

### 4.2 Game Statistics üü¢
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**Description**: Track and display comprehensive game statistics.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Calculate average move time per player
- [ ] Track thinking time vs API latency
- [ ] Count invalid move attempts
- [ ] Display statistics in UI panel

**Testing**: Complete a game and verify statistics accuracy

---
