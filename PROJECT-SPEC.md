# Chess LLM Orchestration System - Product Specification

## Executive Summary

The Chess LLM Orchestration System is a web-based platform that enables different Large Language Models (LLMs) to play chess against each other in real-time. The system provides a visual interface for watching AI-vs-AI chess matches, complete with move validation, timing, and game analysis.

## Product Vision

### Core Value Proposition
- **Automated LLM Chess Tournaments**: Watch state-of-the-art language models compete in chess
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Pit models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others against each other
- **Real-time Visualization**: See moves happen live with a professional chess interface
- **Performance Analytics**: Compare how different models perform at chess strategy

### Target Users
1. **AI Researchers**: Studying LLM reasoning capabilities through chess
2. **Chess Enthusiasts**: Interested in AI approaches to chess
3. **Developers**: Learning about LLM integration and real-time systems
4. **Educators**: Demonstrating AI capabilities in a visual, engaging way

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Game Management

#### 1.1 Game Creation
- **One-Click Start**: Simple "Start LLM Game" button to begin a match
- **Model Selection**: Option for random assignment of LLMs to white/black pieces or user can use Dropdown menus to choose specific models for each player

#### 1.2 Game Flow
- **Automated Play**: LLMs play without human intervention, given the same system instructions and same prompts. Time is tracked for each side black/white. Game ends via checkmate, agreed upon draw, resignation, stalemate, or if time runs out.
- **Move Validation**: All moves validated by chess engine before execution, bad responses or bad moves are rejected and a standrd response is sent to the LLM to re-process, this all happens while time is ticking on that LLM's clock.
- **Referee System**: Dedicated LLM referee for ambiguous situations
- **Game Termination**: Automatic detection of checkmate, stalemate, draws

#### 1.3 Game Controls
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause at any point and resume later
- **Reset**: Clear board and start fresh
- **Step Mode**: Advance one move at a time for analysis
- **Speed Control**: Adjust delay between moves (instant to 5 seconds)

### 2. LLM Integration

#### 2.1 Supported Providers
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, claude 3 haiku, claude 4 sonnet, claude 4 opus
- **Google**: Gemini Pro (via API)
- **Alibaba Cloud**: Qwen models
- **OpenRouter**: Access to 50+ models through unified API

#### 2.2 Agent Capabilities
- **Move Generation**: LLMs receive a "your turn" prompt with: board state, which color they are playing, what their opponents last move was. They must respond with a valid chess move or 'REQUEST_DRAW' or 'RESIGN'. If the last move from the opponent was to request a draw they can also respond with 'DRAW_ACCEPTED' or 'DRAW_REFUSED'.
- **Error Recovery**: Referee/orchestrator handles invalid moves or invalid/bad responses out of the expected ones by sending a standard "invalid response" prompt back to the LLM to advise that the previous response was not valid, include that response for clarity, and also include the board state, color, and opponents last move and ask for a valid response.
- **Timeout Handling**: Time is removed from one color at a time during their turn. Orchestrator processing time is not counted, only the time between prompt and response is deducted from that color's clock. During orchestrator processing we should increment a 3rd clock and put a visual indicaor so players understand why the player clocks have paused, and we can track how long the orchestration takes too.

#### 2.3 Configuration
- **Per-Model Settings**: Temperature, max tokens.
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits automatically
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor API usage and estimated costs
- **Fallback Chains**: Secondary models if primary fails
